# Deep-Variational-Information-Bottlenck

Here in this repository you can find a simple implementation of Deep variational Information Bottleneck. The idea of information bottleneck is very simple.

You have an input $X$, 
You have its corresponding labels $Y$,
You look for a latent variable (clearly much less dimension as $X$) $Z$ by optimizing
